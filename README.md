# Postcards from Gothenburg
Postcards from Gothenburg is a photography project carried out during a 
HDK-Valand course in summer 2021.

A more complete description is coming soon.

## Website
Visit the website by clicking [here](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/).

The mediocre code (most of the code actually) comes from W3schools examples.
The bad code is my own and please don't look at it. Forking is highly discouraged, let's not ever propagate this programming mess.

## Deployment (note to self)
Deployment requires `npm`. 
After pushing your changes, run

```
npm run deploy
```
