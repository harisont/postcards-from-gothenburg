# Project description

## Photographic project

### Working title
_Postcards from Gothenburg_.

### Introduction
The project consists in a series of playful architecture photography experiments.

The idea is to select a number of well-known buildings and landmarks and produce, for each of them, a pair of pictures.
Each pair should consist of an experimental shot that tries to transform the subject by for instance displaying it in an unusual situation, emphasizing one detail or choosing an unconventional angle, and a more "traditional", postcard-like one aimed at making it immediately recognizable.

The pictures will then be organized as a guessing game where the former pictures act as riddles and the latter as solutions (see **Release**). 

### Objectives
Most importantly, this project is a first attempt to work with photography systematically.
While collecting even a large number of individually interesting pictures over the course of a few years can be a relatively easy task, this is not the case when it comes to a more structured project revolving around a specific theme and carried out in a limited amount of time. 
As an additional challenge, one of the goals is for at least the more "traditional" pictures to be stylistically coherent with each other.

A secondary aim is to experiment with a new genre, architecture photography, and to improve my technical skills. With respect to this, the fact that the project is carried out in the context of a course is crucial, as it makes it easy to get feedback and guidance.

At the same time, working on this project provides with a chance to reflect on the role of different buildings, on the general relation between them and the residents and in particular on the specific relation between Göteborg's buildings and myself.

### Method
The project will be carried out entirely in Göteborg and its suburbs, with not much more than a compact mirrorless camera and a tripod as equipment. 
This will make it easy to move from one location to another and to visit the same location multiple times. 
In particular, each location will be visited at least three times, in the different phases of the project (see also **Timetable**).

#### Phase 1: getting ideas
The very first step is the choice of subjects itself, which will require (re-)visiting and selecting from a long list of places.
While there will be a very subjective component to it, the chosen buildings and landmarks need be familiar at least to the people living in the area they are located in. 
For instance, Kvibergs Marknad might not be known to every single inhabitant of the entire city, but is definitely a reference point for those who live in Östra Göteborg. 

As a consequence, a building/landmark is a good candidate for being part of the project if:
- it is relatively well known at least withing its area
- it suggests a possibility of "transformation".

Additional selective criteria might be added during this same phase. 
For example, I might choose to focus only on industrial and/or postindustrial buildings.

This phase will also include some actual photography, but this is mostly to be intended as visual notetaking (not necessarily using the camera used for the final shots) and practice.

#### Phase 2: experimental shots
Once an almost definitive list of places has been defined, it is time for the experimental, "transformative" and definitely non postcard-like shots.

Even excluding editing interventions altogether, there are endless ways a building can be transformed, for instance:
- emphasizing (or exclusively showing) a detail
- choosing an unconventional angle
- photographing a very colorful subject in black and white (or vice versa)
- not showing the subject directly, but rather its reflection on the water or on a window
- photographing by night a place that is only popular by day (or vice versa)
- making a building with a certain function (e.g. a factory) look like a building for some other purpose (e.g. a church)
- showing the back of a building instead of its facade.

The only constraint here will be using a ratio typical of postcards (this is required for the final form the project will take - see **Release**). 

#### Phase 3: postcards
After getting creative, the penultimate step is an equally challenging one: going back to each location and photographing it in the most conventional and descriptive way possible. 
Pictures should resemble those in postcards and guidebooks.

This means, for most buildings, showing their facade. 
For other landmarks, conventional angles and lighting conditions will be used.

The reason for the above phases taking place in this order is that phase 2 is more likely to cause the list of locations to change.

#### Phase 4: refinements
Towards the end of the summer, a short time will be saved for minor edits, retaking unsatisfactory pictures and preparing the final shots for the final release.

### Timetable
(phases overlap with each other)

| period | activity | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| start of the course - week 26 | phase 1 (getting ideas + practice) | |
| week 27-28 | phase 2 (experimental shots) | will have a lot of time to focus on the course and work intensely
| week 28-31 | phase 3 ("postcards") | 3 weeks are dedicated to this as I will be attending and teaching a summer school at the same time |
| week 31 - end of the course | phase 4 (refinements) | ideally, project complete already in the first half of week 32 |


### Budget
To take this summer course, I will be working half time (and, as a consequence, for half the salary) throughout the summer. 
For this reason, and also for some concerns related to the current global health issues, I have chosen a zero-budget project that does not require any traveling or special equipment.

At the same time, I do not exclude a photo book as part of the final release. 
In that case, I plan to print one or two copies of a postcard-format one, assuming from past experiences that the cost of doing that goes not too much beyond 1000 sek.

### Release
The "guessing game" aspect of the project makes an interactive website the perfect way to display this work. 
The idea here is to build a gallery of impossible, three-sided postcards, where: 
1. the side that is immediately visible shows the experimental shot
2. by clicking on it, the user sees something similar to what is usually on the back of a postcard: an address (in this case the address of where the picture was taken) and a short message, saying something about how the picture was taken or giving it a title
3. by clicking on the postcard again, the user does not go back to side 1, but is shown the postcard-like image.

However, in a completely textless format, the project can also work well as a small book, with the experimental pictures on the right-hand pages and the more traditional ones on the left hand ones.

## Plan for the course
Aside from what stated in the **Timetable**, a major part of the course work consist in reading and writing for the literature review (book yet to be chosen). 
The plan for this is to dedicate the first 20 days of July to this, using at most the first 7 for a first read.

Finally, my artist statement and end of term reflection will be written during phase 4 (see above).
